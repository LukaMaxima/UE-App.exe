# UE-App.exe

Scope

    This is an attempt to automate some of the more time-consuming and (if youâ€™re anything like me) prone-to-human-error aspects of playing Ultimate Europe using Python.

    Benefits include:
        Automated PV calculations across First, Reserve, and Youth teams.
        Easy team selections without player codes using auto-filtering dropdowns to select your teams.
        Automated MDS submissions for all teams, including automated code inputs.
        Save data locally to submit your MDS later, allowing rapid resubmissions.
        Alerts if a player has a low or N/A PV for the chosen position.
        Automated scouting (currently limited to country).

### Download

- The .zip containing the files is too large for GitHub, so I've stored it over on a Google Drive. You can locate it here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zl0MfLx_4pFBiFcCqSswTe7ry6wKUvLS

-----

### Requirements

- There is no install for this other than you need Firefox for the app to work.
- Additional dependencies such as Python, Java, Chrome and any related Python libraries are **NOT** required for this version of the app.

-----

### Install

- Extract (unzip) the downloaded `.zip` file where you want it. You're ready to go

-----

### Notes on use

- You will need to scan your turns with the dedicated scanner.exe. The MDS Import function in the app doesn't currently work.
- Windows Defender may block the apps running on the first time. You can resolve this by clicking `More Info` > `Run Anyway`
