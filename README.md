# UE-App.exe

### Download

- The .zip containing the files is too large for GitHub, so I've stored it over on a Google Drive. You can locate it here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zl0MfLx_4pFBiFcCqSswTe7ry6wKUvLS

-----

### Requirements

- There is no install for this other than you need Firefox for the app to work.
- Additional dependencies such as Python, Java, Chrome and any related Python libraries are **NOT** required for this version of the app.

-----

### Install

- Extract (unzip) the downloaded `.zip` file where you want it. You're ready to go

-----

### Notes on use

- You will need to scan your turns with the dedicated scanner.exe. The MDS Import function in the app doesn't currently work.
- Windows Defender may block the apps running on the first time. You can resolve this by clicking `More Info` > `Run Anyway`
